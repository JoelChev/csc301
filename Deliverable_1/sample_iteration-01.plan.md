## Process

(Optional:) Introduction

Met as a group, this includes Joel, Martin and Eric.

#### Roles & responsibilities

Martin: Facilitator. Will write issues on Github and have a central oversight over the JetUML program.
Joel: Developer. Will work on issues from Github and develop features for the application.
Eric: Developer. Will work on issues from Github and develop features for the application.


#### Events

We will meet weekly to check on the progress of the team. Each member will communicate their progress on development, their issues/blockers, request clarification if necessary. The purpose of the meetings is to ensure that the project is on track and that everyone is contributing. Martin will lead the meetings.

#### Artifacts

We will be maintaining a Github repository to track our work, issues and progress. We will be using Github issues to track how items are prioritized and assigned.
For example:


## Product

Goals: Assign work evenly and begin development on the initial issues of the project.

Tasks: Create Github repository, with issues.

Artifacts: We will produce a viable Github page with issues by the end of the week that is accessible for all group members and ideally begin pushing valid code for the project.
