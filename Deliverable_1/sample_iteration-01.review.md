# JetUML/Team JetUML

## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: Jan 20, 2015
 * Where: Martin's Office

## Process - Reflection

(Optional) Short introduction

Joel, Eric and Martin made great progress this week on the project.

Decisions turned out well:

-Decided to follow an Agile Development Process: Allowed for issues to be assigned and developed more quickly on the Github repository.
-Assigned story points to each issue to give it priority/importance in future sprints: The Github issues now have numbers next to them that list their importance going forward.
-The weekly meeting formalized our schedules and got us all on the same page for the iteration: The Github page is now up to date as a result.


Decisions did not turn out as well as you hoped:

-Deciding to have two developers lead to some confusion: Some issues were not assigned this week and are up in the air.
-Communicating over email was too slow.
 
We are planning to make the following changes to our process:

We will start a Slack channel to communicate more quickly going forward. This will address communication slowness.

We will address our process so that at the beginning of each sprint all issues will be assigned to each developer. This will reduce confusion and churn in the code and ensure that everything is completed, or at least addressed every week.

## Product - Review

Goals/tasks that were met/completed:

We created a Github repository with issues. It is here:
https://github.com/prmr/JetUML

There are issues with story points, allowing for efficient work estimation. 


Goals/tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

N/A

(Optional) Goals/tasks that were not originally planned, but ended up being not met/completed:

N/A


Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

Timelines will need to be established, or at least estimated for each issue. We need to estimate/track our progress in terms of time. A burnup chart could be helpful too.

We need to communicate more quickly.

We need to ensure issues are picked up/assigned evenly.

We have to continue meeting weekly as that keeps us on track.
