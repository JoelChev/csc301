# JetUML/Team JetUML

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

A desktop program for creating, distributing and documenting Software Projects through UML diagrams. It will be distributed on the web. It will allow users to model Class, Object, State, Sequence and Use Case Diagrams. It will have the ability to save UML diagrams as program-specific files or export them as image files. Copying, pasting and taking screenshots of diagrams/diagram components will be supported.


#### Q2: Who are your target users?

Our target users are educational, industrial and hobbyist software developers that wish to model their software projects in UML. 

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem?

Our users will use our product due to its portability, lightweight scale and ability to collaborate on UML diagrams. It will be a modern application for UML modelling. The feature set will be rich (copying, pasting, cropping) while not compromising on space or memory requirments, which in our books is a huge win. Moreover, there are not currently any free options on the market for software developers to model their projects while allowing for easy distribution and collaboration. The learning curve for our application will be light, allowing for users to quickly pick it up and use it to their pleasure. 

Alternatively we could use a web-based application, but that will require an internet connection. We want users to be able to work on their models remotely and without internet.

We decided to go this route as it has been tested and tried in the past and makes sense for current developers. We aim to build the ultimate UML modelling tool, to enrich the lives of developers everywhere!
